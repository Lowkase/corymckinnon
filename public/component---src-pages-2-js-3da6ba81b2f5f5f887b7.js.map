First, I parsed through multiple documents to condense the workbench ruleset into a concise list of \n                        requirements.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The Twitter team supplied me with dozens of screen capture videos of moderators in action, this source of real-life interactions\n                        proved to be invaluable for the remainder of the project. \n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The videos exposed many pain points that inhibited the moderators from producing faster SAR scores. Moderators used many \n                        different browser tabs to view Tweets, user accounts, keyword searches, and to translate text into their native languages. \n                        Moderators were spending a significant amount of time copying and pasting text between browser tabs. \n                        We went back to the Twitter team and confirmed the validity of the pain points and determined that addressing them would help to increase \n                        SARs scores. \n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We had a large amount of data compiled detailing how moderators flowed through the workbench. After mapping the data, we met with the \n                        Twitter team to confirm our assumptions. It took a few iterations to get a correct baseline which we then used as a source of\n                        truth for going wide during the design phase. \n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-3.jpg'} alt=\"Early prototype\" />\n                        <figcaption>Mapping the Twitter moderator experience</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        Including the Twitter team in every step of the design process was very important. \n                        We brought together key stakeholders and moderators for a “What If” exercise allowing us to go wide with our thinking.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-5.jpg'} alt=\"What if exercise\" />\n                        <figcaption>What if exercise</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        Based on observations from the research and ideation sessions it was clear we needed to bring all data\n                        points that the moderators required inline to the app. Accessing data across multiple browser tabs was costing \n                        moderators time. We also needed to give the moderators tools to translate and\n                        copy text with ease. I spent time producing mock-ups with different layouts, interactions and ideas and met \n                        again with the team to validate.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-6.jpg'} alt=\"An initial mockup\" />\n                        <figcaption>An initial mockup</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        While the team agreed with most design concepts, the interface was busy and missed important elements. \n                        We continued to brainstorm and iterate the design to take away extraneous items (history section), \n                        add small, useful features (inline translation and batch/task progress) and improved interactions \n                        (minimize tasks when completed).\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-7.jpg'} alt=\"High fidelity wireframe, very close\" />\n                        <figcaption>High-fidelity wireframe, very close</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* SOLUTION */}\n            <Section className=\"section-secondary\">\n                <div className=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Solution</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        Once the design was complete and we had stakeholder sign-off, I finalized the wireframes and acceptance criteria.\n                        We met with engineering to kick off the development phase and had touchpoints with them regularly to ensure the design was \n                        understood and implemented correctly.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        After the workbench had been in production for a few weeks, we were able to pull some stats and reactions from \n                        the Twitter team to back up our initial goals and KPIs.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight-grid\">\n                        <div className=\"m-highlight-grid-row m-highlight-grid-3\">\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">SAR scores increased by 22%</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Managers had more trust in the SAR data to identify top and bottom performers.</div> \n                        </div> \n                    </div>\n                    <p></p>\n                    <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n                    <p></p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">\n                        It was important to have many touchpoints with the Twitter team and include them in the design process.
