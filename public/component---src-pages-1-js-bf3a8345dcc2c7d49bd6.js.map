An important piece to the online home buying ecosystem is the Build and Price\n                        experience which allows users to find the type of new home they want and to do some customizations before\n                        saving it to their My Homes profile.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The first version of Build and Price had poor conversions of a key metric called Save.

We also observed hesitation when clicking some action buttons due to confusing\n                        language what was industry specific to new home builders. Most users where dropping out of the experience before\n                        converting and saving their Build and Price.\n                    </p>                    \n                    <p>\n                        When we interviewed Ownly&#39;s customers they expressed frustration by the quality and fidelity of the interface \n                        and requested features that had already been identified on the product roadmap.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">\n                        How can we redesign the Build and Price experience to increase save conversions?\n                    </div>                     \n                    <p>\n                        We brought the entire team together, helped them to empathize with user and customer pain points, then we\n                        defined our goals for the next version of Build and Price:\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight-grid m-highlight-last\">\n                        <div className=\"m-highlight-grid-row m-highlight-grid-3\">\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Increase conversions by 20%</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Simplify navigation</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Improve fidelity of look and feel</div>\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Normalize language</div> \n                        </div> \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* PROCESS */}\n            <Section>\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Process</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        We didn&#39;t have a clear picture of all the features, flows and rules associated with the current Build and \n                        Price. We took a bit of time to map the system and create an initial source of truth that the entire \n                        team could reference as a baseline.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We were intent on studying real-life experiences with Build and Price so we started watching many Hotjar \n                        sessions. It quickly became apparent that users were spending most of their time finding a new home type \n                        and then exploring customization options. We needed to concentrate on these two experiences in order to \n                        meet our design goals.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        After meeting with a few of our builder customers we were able to prioritize two new features in the \n                        road map for the next version of Build and Price. With the help of engineering we agreed that better \n                        filtering for new home types and an improved lot selection experience had low technical constraints and \n                        had a high probability of being built in a tight time frame.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        It was time to go wide with ideation and simple design exercises. We wanted to use early mockups to start validating \n                        ideas and to get feedback from the team, our customers and the users.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/ownly-3.jpg'} alt=\"Early prototypes\" />\n                        <figcaption>Early prototypes prototye</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        After many iterations we were onto something good, the language was improving, the new features were slotting\n                        in but the navigation and layouts of some steps wasn&#39;t simple, we were still getting confused, it was too busy.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight\">\n                        It quickly become apparent that car manufacturer Build and Price navigation was the key to a better \n                        experience for our customers.\n                    </div>  \n                    <p>\n                        We needed to step back and do a bit more research on how the Build and Price steps were sequenced and laid out.\n                        We looked at other manufacturers of \"big ticket\" purchases and landed on how the car manufacturing\n                        sector approached Build and Price.
