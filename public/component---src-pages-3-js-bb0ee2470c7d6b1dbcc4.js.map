Users search these moments to find movement in a room, specific purchases and \n                        unusual employee behaviour.

We found a promising candidate while exploring the Intercom app. Intercom combines simple \n                        object-based search inputs with complicated SQL-like concepts into one experience.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/solink-4.gif'} style={{border: '1px solid #2b2c34'}} alt=\"Intercom inspiration\" />\n                        <figcaption>Intercom inspiration</figcaption>\n                    </figure>    \n                    <p>\n                        We wanted to test the Intercom pattern on our Events page, but first, we spent some time iterating a design. \n                        We did many rounds of design and feedback from engineering to ensure we did not exceed any technical constraints. \n                        At intervals, we reached out for feedback internally and from our select customers. We had to make some tweaks along \n                        the way, but there were no derailments. Finally, it was time to move to development.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/solink-5.jpg'} alt=\"Supporting modals and interactions\" />\n                        <figcaption>Supporting modals and interactions</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* SOLUTION */}\n            <Section className=\"section-secondary\">\n                <div className=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Solution</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        While the interfaces and interactions for the final design were somewhat simple, the systems engineering to pull off the \n                        experience was technically challenging. We needed to step into the complexity of the feature over many sprints. We set up\n                        recurring touchpoints with engineering to plan sprints and bridge the gap between design and development.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We were able to start pulling metrics from the new search experience as features went live. The most striking stat \n                        was engagement. Users were spending, on average, 11% more time on the Events page. Users showed increased activity in creating reports \n                        from their custom searches and assigning them to the Dashboard.
