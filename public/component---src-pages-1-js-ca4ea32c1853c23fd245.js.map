An important piece of the online home-buying ecosystem is the Build and Price experience \n                        which allows users to find the type of new home they want and to do some customizations before saving it to their \n                        My Homes profile.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The first version of Build and Price had poor conversions of a key metric called Save. Users must Sign Up for an \n                        Ownly account before their Build and Price information can be saved to a My Homes profile. When we studied user \n                        experiences on Hotjar we saw them getting frustrated when navigating, some users even got lost and dropped off very \n                        early. We also observed hesitation when clicking some action buttons due to confusing language that was industry \n                        specific to new home builders. Most users were dropping out of the experience before converting and saving their \n                        Build and Price.\n                    </p>                    \n                    <p>\n                        When we interviewed Ownly's customers they expressed frustration with the quality and fidelity of the interface and \n                        requested features that had already been identified on the product roadmap.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">\n                        How can we redesign the Build and Price experience to increase save conversions?\n                    </div>                     \n                    <p>\n                        We brought the entire team together, helped them to empathize with the user and customer pain points, then we \n                        defined our goals for the next version of Build and Price:\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight-grid m-highlight-last\">\n                        <div className=\"m-highlight-grid-row m-highlight-grid-3\">\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Increase conversions by 20%</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Simplify navigation</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Improve fidelity of look and feel</div>\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Normalize language</div> \n                        </div> \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* PROCESS */}\n            <Section>\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Process</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        We didn't have a clear picture of all the features, flows and rules associated with the current Build and Price. \n                        We took a bit of time to map the system and create an initial source of truth that the entire team could reference as a baseline.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We were intent on studying real-life experiences with Build and Price so we started watching many Hotjar sessions. It quickly \n                        became apparent that users were spending most of their time finding a new home type and then exploring customization options. \n                        We needed to concentrate on these two experiences in order to meet our design goals.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        After meeting with a few of our builder customers we were able to prioritize two new features in the roadmap for the next \n                        version of Build and Price. With the help of engineering, we agreed that better filtering for new home types and an improved \n                        lot selection experience had low technical constraints and a high probability of being built in a tight time frame.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        It was time to go wide with ideation and simple design exercises. We wanted to use early mockups to start validating ideas \n                        and to get feedback from the team, our customers and the users.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/ownly-3.jpg'} alt=\"Early prototypes\" />\n                        <figcaption>Early prototye</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        After many iterations we were onto something good, the language was improving, and the new features were slotting in but \n                        the navigation and layouts of some steps weren't simple, we were still getting confused, and it was too busy.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight\">\n                        It quickly become apparent that car manufacturer Build and Price navigation was the key to a better experience for our customers.\n                    </div>  \n                    <p>\n                        We needed to step back and do a bit more research on how the Build and Price steps were sequenced and laid out.
