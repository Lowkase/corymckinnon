The annotated data is collated and sent back to Twitter to prime its ML \n                        algorithms ensuring the Twitter Spam  Violation AI becomes more accurate over time.\n                        Moderators are scored by how many batches of tasks they can complete in a working session (SAR score).

After a few meetings with the Twitter team, \n                        product management and engineering it was determined that the best course of action was to improve the workbench \n                        experience for moderators.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">\n                        How can the Twitter Spam Violation Workbench be improved to increase moderator SARs scores, consistency and quality?\n                    </div>                     \n                    <p>\n                        The team agreed upon a couple of KPIs in order to measure success and then we hit the ground running.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight-grid m-highlight-last\">\n                        <div className=\"m-highlight-grid-row m-highlight-grid-3\">\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Increase SAR scores by 10%</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Better identify moderators that have the highest volume, impact and revenue</div> \n                        </div> \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* PROCESS */}\n            <Section>\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Process</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        As the sole designer on the project I needed to get a clear picture of the workbench rules and how moderators flowed through the Spam \n                        Violation annotation process. First, I parsed through multiple documents to condense the workbench ruleset into a concise list of \n                        requirements.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The Twitter team supplied me with dozens of screen capture videos of moderators in action, this source of real-life interactions\n                        proved to be invaluable for the remainder of the project. \n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The videos exposed many pain points that inhibited the moderators from producing faster SAR scores. Moderators used many \n                        different browser  tabs to view Tweets, user accounts, keyword searches, and to translate text into their native languages. \n                        Moderators where spending a lot of time copying and pasting text between browser tabs. We went back to the Twitter team and \n                        confirmed that the pain points were valid and that addressing them would help to increase \n                        SARs scores. \n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We had a large amount of data compiled on how moderators flowed through the workbench so I mapped it out and met with the \n                        Twitter team to confirm my assumptions. It took a few iterations to get a correct baseline that we then used as a source of\n                        truth for going wide on the design. \n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-3.jpg'} alt=\"Early prototypes\" />\n                        <figcaption>Mapping the Twitter moderator experience</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        It was important to include the Twitter team in every step of the design process to ensure their voice was heard. \n                        I gathered some key stakeholders and a few moderators together for a “What If” exercise to go wide with our thinking.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-5.jpg'} alt=\"What if exercise\" />\n                        <figcaption>What if exercise</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        The key observation coming out of the research and ideation was that we needed to bring the information that the \n                        moderators were viewing in separate browser tabs inline into the app and give the moderators tools to avoid copying \n                        and pasting repetitively. I spent some time producing mock-ups with different layouts, interactions and ideas and met \n                        again with the team to do some validation.\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-6.jpg'} alt=\"An initial mockup\" />\n                        <figcaption>An initial mockup</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>\n                        While the team agreed with most of the design concepts the interface still seemed busy and missed some key elements. \n                        We brainstormed as a team and continued to iterate the design to take away some extraneous elements (history section), \n                        add in some small but very useful features (inline translation and batch/task progress) and clean up some interactions \n                        (minimize tasks when completed).\n                    </p>\n                    <figure className=\"m-figure\">\n                        <img src={'/twitter-7.jpg'} alt=\"High fidelity wireframe, very close\" />\n                        <figcaption>High fidelity wireframe, very close</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n            </Section>\n\n            {/* SOLUTION */}\n            <Section className=\"section-secondary-color\">\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <h2>Solution</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        Once the design was complete and we had sign-off from all stakeholders I finalized the designs by ensuring all use cases \n                        were represented and that the acceptance criterion was included right in the design files. We met with engineering to kick \n                        off the development and had touchpoints with them on a very regular basis to ensure the design was understood and implemented \n                        correctly.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        After a few weeks with the new workbench being used in production, we were able to pull some stats and reactions from \n                        the Twitter team to back up our initial goals and KPIs.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight-grid\">\n                        <div className=\"m-highlight-grid-row m-highlight-grid-3\">\n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">SAR scores increased by 22%</div> \n                            <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">Managers had more trust in the SAR data to identify top and bottom performers.</div> \n                        </div> \n                    </div>\n                    <p></p>\n                    <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n                    <p></p>\n                    <div className=\"m-highlight m-hightlight-invert\">\n                        It was important to have many touchpoints with the Twitter team and include them in the design process.
